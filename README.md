# Mall Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on segmenting customers of a mall based on their annual income and spending score using K-Means clustering.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing and business strategy. This project aims to group mall customers into distinct segments to understand their behaviors better, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on 200 mall customers, including their gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Load and explore the dataset.
2. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of features.
3. **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features for clustering.
4. **Optimal Number of Clusters**: Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
5. **K-Means Clustering**: Apply K-Means clustering to segment the customers.
6. **Cluster Analysis**: Analyze the resulting clusters to gain insights.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lourdhu02/Mall-Customer-Segmentation.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. **Run the `Mall_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` notebook to see the results**.

## Results

The K-Means clustering algorithm successfully segmented the customers into distinct clusters based on their annual income and spending score. The visualizations and cluster analysis provided insights into the characteristics of each customer segment.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of K-Means clustering in customer segmentation. By understanding the different segments, businesses can develop targeted marketing strategies to better meet the needs of their customers.
